Our Team, Mission, and Why You Should Join Us

We are the Common Platform Engineering - GenAI team, a central group in the Chief Technology Office (CTO). We're a focused agile team that owns our work from idea to production.

Our culture is built on a shared belief in engineering craftsmanship, backed by leadership that understands what that means. We're on a journey to prove what's possible inside a large organization, and that means navigating some legacy while building the future. This isn't a role for someone who wants everything to be perfect on day one. It's for an engineer who wants to be part of the team that gets us there, influencing how we solve problems and raising our collective bar through their work.

We have a dual mission: build 'Citi Assist,' the GenAI digital assistant for our colleagues, and provide the platforms and guidance that enable the entire organization to adopt GenAI safely and effectively.

We have a dual mission: build 'Citi Assist,' the GenAI digital assistant for our colleagues, and provide the platforms and guidance that enable the entire organisation to adopt GenAI safely and effectively.

This is not a typical banking job. You will build foundational technology that has a direct, positive impact on hundreds of thousands of people. You'll have the executive support to tackle big problems and the autonomy to help shape our solutions. Most importantly, you will join a passionate, collaborative team where we all learn from each other, and we succeed or fail as one.

Software Developer,Delhi,C# Software Developer,Crossover,New Delhi,Crossover,Full-time and Contractor,,"You’re an engineer who doesn’t tolerate bad code, slow deployments, or outdated development practices. You don’t just write software—you build AI-driven systems that make traditional engineering look sluggish and inefficient. If that sounds like you, keep reading.

Most software teams are still writing code the old way—manual debugging, trial-and-error deployments, and features that barely leverage AI beyond a sprinkle of Copilot suggestions. Trilogy is different. Every part of our development process is infused with AI: feature ideation, bug detection, defect resolution, and performance optimization. This isn’t about dabbling in AI tools; this is about fully integrating AI into the software lifecycle to eliminate waste, ship faster, and build with precision.

In this role, you will take existing B2B products, break them down, rebuild them as cloud-native applications, and optimize them with AI at every level. You’ll be developing and deploying AI-powered features, using cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn’t it.

If you’re ready to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high-scale cloud-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn’t for you.

What you will be doing
• Using analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.
• Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud-native applications.
• Collaborating with a global team to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade solutions.

What you won’t be doing
• Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.
• Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking.

AI-First Software Engineer II key responsibilities
• Implement AI-driven features to streamline workflows and empower service providers with innovative tools.

Basic Requirements
• 4+ years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server-side web applications
• Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0.dev); we are not looking for traditional ML engineers without LLM experience
• A willingness to use GenAI in your day-to-day development work

Software Developer,Kolkata,Java Software Developer,Crossover,Kolkata,Crossover,Full-time and Contractor,,"You’re an engineer who doesn’t tolerate bad code, slow deployments, or outdated development practices. You don’t just write software—you build AI-driven systems that make traditional engineering look sluggish and inefficient. If that sounds like you, keep reading.

Most software teams are still writing code the old way—manual debugging, trial-and-error deployments, and features that barely leverage AI beyond a sprinkle of Copilot suggestions. Trilogy is different. Every part of our development process is infused with AI: feature ideation, bug detection, defect resolution, and performance optimization. This isn’t about dabbling in AI tools; this is about fully integrating AI into the software lifecycle to eliminate waste, ship faster, and build with precision.

In this role, you will take existing B2B products, break them down, rebuild them as cloud-native applications, and optimize them with AI at every level. You’ll be developing and deploying AI-powered features, using cutting-edge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for automated defect detection, and ensuring every release is smooth—zero outages, zero disruptions, zero excuses. If you're looking for a job where you spend weeks debating architecture decisions instead of shipping, this isn’t it.

If you’re ready to push the boundaries of AI-driven software engineering and accelerate your career into high-scale cloud-native development, apply now. If you prefer sticking to what you already know, writing test cases by hand, or working in teams that are afraid of automation, this isn’t for you.

What you will be doing
• Using analysis tools and RAG vector stores to identify, diagnose, and correct product defects and fix bugs.
• Leveraging AI development agents to design, develop, and deploy innovative features for cloud-native applications.
• Collaborating with a global team to deliver high-quality, enterprise-grade solutions.

What you won’t be doing
• Routine Monotony: We keep cumbersome infrastructure tasks to a minimum so you can focus on creating innovative solutions.
• Endless Meetings: We value your expertise in development over sitting in meeting rooms. Expect more coding, less talking.

AI-First Software Engineer II key responsibilities
• Implement AI-driven features to streamline workflows and empower service providers with innovative tools.

Basic Requirements
• 4+ years of professional experience in commercial software development, focusing on production code for server-side web applications
• Experience using GenAI code assistants (e.g., Github Copilot, Cursor, v0.dev); we are not looking for traditional ML engineers without LLM experience
• A willingness to use GenAI in your day-to-day development work
